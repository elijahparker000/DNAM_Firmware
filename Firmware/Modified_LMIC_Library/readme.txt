To get the LoRa module to work I had to modify the name of a function in this library to get around a naming conflict. There were two functions being used which were named hal_init. One was used by this library, and I believe the other one is used in the driver for the ESP board. I modified the one used by this library to be named hal_init1. I hope I didn't break anything too badly, but I can get this code to talk to the gateway.

To use the library, just unzip this file and paste the contents into your Arduino libraries folder. The path should look something like "Arduino\libraries\arduino-lmic" where the arduino-lmic library folder contains the src folder, examples folder, etc.
